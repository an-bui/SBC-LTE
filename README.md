# LTE-trajectories

This is a repository for projects involving the SBC's LTE data.

## Data

All files were pulled from [SBC LTER Data Catalog](https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/data/catalog/) on 7 December 2020.

| Category | Files | Notes | 
| -------- | ----- | ----------- | 
| [Cover of sessile organisms, UPC](https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/9ef0a3d317f6553e1600a0e5af016e43) | LTE_Cover_All_Years_20200605.csv, LTE_Substrate_All_Years_20200605.csv | 80 points along transect, species percent cover is determined as the fraction of points a species intercepts x 100, kelps (_Macrocystis_, _Pterygophora_, _Eisenia_, _Laminaria_) only measured using holdfasts, includes all sessile organisms encountered | 
| [Abundance and size of Giant Kelp]() | LTE_Kelp_All_Years_20200605.csv |  |
| [Fish abundance]() | LTE_All_Fish_All_Years_20200605.csv |  |
| [Invertebrate and algal density]() | LTE_Quad_Swath_All_Years_20200605.csv |  |
| [Biomass of kelp forest species]() | LTE_All_Species_Biomass_at_transect_20200605.csv | Biomass taken from UPC (cover) or density (quad swath), converted using coefficients for estimating biomass from body size or percent cover for [macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=127) |
| [Detritus Biomass]() | LTE_Detritus_Biomass_All_Years_20200605.csv | Measured in 6 quadrats along transect, detritus is collected and weighed in lab |
| [Urchin size frequency distribution]() | LTE_Urchin_All_Years_20200605.csv | At least 50 individuals of _Strongylocentrotus franciscanus_ and _S. purpuratus_ measured along transects |
| [Understory kelp allometrics]() | Allometrics_All_Years_20131009.csv | Taken for _Laminaria farlowii_ and _Pterygophora californica_ between 2008-2012 to predict biomass from
density data of different size classes |
| [Transect depth data]() | LTE_Transect_Depths_coors.csv | taken once by dive computer |
| [Taxon-specific seasonal net primary production (NPP) for macroalgae]() | Understory_NPP_All_Year_season_20200605.csv, Understory_Summer_Bmass...20191122.csv |  |
| [Hourly photon irradiance at the surface and seafloor]() | Hourly_Irrandiance_All_Year_20200320.csv |  |
